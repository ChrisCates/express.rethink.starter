## An Express, RethinkDB, Redis Starter pack by Chris Cates

I've decided since I start so many projects the same way I should open source a starter pack for all to enjoy.

### Scripts

1. `npm start` - runs the server (TODO: make it run with PM2).
2. `npm run dev` - runs the server in development mode `gulp`.
3. `npm test` - runs unit tests in Mocha and SuperTest
4. `npm run nyc` - runs unit tests with NYC and Coveralls

### Installation Instructions

1. Install node modules `npm install`.
2. Install RethinkDB.
3. Install Redis.
4. Make sure `config.development.json` matches your environment settings
